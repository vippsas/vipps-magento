### Magento 1

Please see: https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-magento-v1

## Prerequisites
* Magento 2.2+
   * [Magento 2 System Requirements](http://devdocs.magento.com/magento-system-requirements.html)
* SSL is installed on your site and active on the Checkout page
* Supported protocols HTTP1/HTTP1.1
   * Magento relies on the [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com), which does not support HTTP/2.
   * HTTP/1.1 must therefore be "forced", typically by using [CPanel](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/EA4/Apache+Module%3A+HTTP2) or similar.
* A verified Vipps Payment merchant account - [sign up here](https://vippsbedrift.no/signup/vippspanett/)

## Installation and Configuration

Please follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)


### Quote Processing Flow

1. When payment was initiated a new record is created on Vipps Quote Monitoring page with status `New`.
1. Magento polls Vipps for orders to process by cron.
1. When order was accepted on Vipps side, Magento is trying to place an order and marks a record as `Placed`
1. When order was cancelled on Vipps side, Magento marks such record as `Cancelled`
1. If order has not been accepted on Vipps side within some period of time so it marked as expired, Magento marks it as `Expired`
1. If order has not been yet accepted on Vipps side and has not been expired yet, Magento marks it as `Processing`. Appropriate message added on record details page.
1. If order accepted on Vipps side but an error occurred during order placement on Magento side, such record marks as `Processing`. Appropriate message added on record details page.
1. Magento is trying to process the same record `3` times and when it failed after `3` times such record marks as `Place Failed`.
1. It is possible to specify that Magento has to cancel Vipps order automatically when appropriate Magento quote was failed so that client's money released. See `Store -> Sales -> Payment Methods -> Vipps -> Cancellation`
1. If it is specified that Magento has to cancel all failed quotes then Magento fetches all records marked as `Place Failed`, cancel them and marks as `Cancelled`
