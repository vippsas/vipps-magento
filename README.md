### Prerequisites
* Magento 2.2.x, Magento 2.3.x, Magento 2.4.x
   * [Magento 2 System Requirements](http://devdocs.magento.com/magento-system-requirements.html)
* SSL is installed on your site and active on the Checkout page
* Supported protocols HTTP1/HTTP1.1
   * Magento relies on the [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com), which does not support HTTP/2.
   * HTTP/1.1 must therefore be "forced", typically by using [CPanel](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/EA4/Apache+Module%3A+HTTP2) or similar.
* A verified Vipps Payment merchant account - [sign up here](https://vippsbedrift.no/signup/vippspanett/)
